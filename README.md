# i3D (iOS component)
## Visualize an iPhone app in 3D space.



See https://github.com/smilli/greylock-hack-web for the front-end web and server-side components.

Note: the URL currently only supports a single device at a time. Device switching may be supported in the future.

I don't intend to personally develop substantial new features. However this project will be maintained - PRs, bug reports, and performance fixes are *greatly* appreciated, and will be reviewed.
